  title: 'The staff of Marotta Medspa are very caring and professional.'
  summary: 'I had the Halo laser treatment and BBL. The results are amazing. My sun damage is gone. Returning for a Visia follow-up analysis, I lost 5 years of aging...in 3 weeks! With the gentle encouragement of Cami, I now follow an easy daily routine of Elta MD skincare, never forgetting my sunblock.'
